## Benefits of Signing Commits

- **Verification:** Just like how signature works, commit signing is a medium to proof that a commit was made by you.
- **Authorization:** Commits signing can prevent unauthorized changes to a repository, if the repository is set to only merge commits that are signed.
- **Integrity:** Signed commits ensure that commits data is not altered externally by someone else.

## Merge Strategies in Git

### Standard Merge

#### Pros:

- **Preserves History:** Maintains the complete history of commits for easy traceability.
- **Simple Conflict Resolution:** Handles conflicts straightforwardly, recording them in a merge commit.

#### Cons:

- **Cluttered History:** The commit history can become cluttered with many branches and merge commits.
- **Complex Graphs:** The commit graph can become complex and harder to read.

### Squash and Merge

#### Pros:

- **Clean History:** Combines all changes from a feature branch into a single commit, resulting in a cleaner history.
- **Simplified Review:** Easier to review a single commit rather than multiple commits.

#### Cons:

- **Loss of Granularity:** Loses individual commit history, making it harder to understand the development process.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Resolving conflicts can be more challenging as changes are squashed into one commit.

### Rebase and Merge

#### Pros:

- **Linear History:** Creates a linear commit history, making it easier to follow.
- **Clean Integration:** Integrates changes cleanly without merge commits.

#### Cons:

- **Risk of Errors:** Rewriting history can lead to errors and requires careful handling.
- **Conflicts Reappear:** Previously resolved conflicts may reappear during the rebase process.
